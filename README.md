Gravity Tumbler
The program must output the result of tumbling a landscape a certain number of times.
Tumbling entails:
- rotating the landscape counterclockwise by 90°
- letting the hash bits # fall down
The map is composed of . and #.
(This puzzle is a twist (hah!) on classic community puzzle “Gravity”. You may want to solve that one first.)
